                <p>Petition: Reverse Victor Ibironke’s Unfair Disqualification for BUCC VP Academics<br>
                    Date: April 9, 2025<br>
                    To the BUCC Electoral Committee,<br>
                    We, the undersigned, demand the reversal of Victor Ibironke’s disqualification from the Babcock University Computer Club (BUCC) Vice President Academics election. Victor, a dedicated student who earned over 640 votes, was disqualified for allegedly campaigning during the election period, an accusation we believe is unjust and unproven.<br>
                    As Babcock students and BUCC members, we’ve seen Victor’s commitment to fairness and academic excellence firsthand. His campaign team, including myself, strictly followed electoral rules, rejecting any misconduct. The massive vote gap—over 640 votes—shows genuine support, not last-minute campaigning. If any unauthorized activity occurred, it wasn’t by Victor or his team, and we were unaware of it.<br>
                    This disqualification threatens the integrity of BUCC elections. Without transparency, trust erodes. We urge the Committee to:<br>
                    1. Provide clear evidence behind this decision.<br>
                    2. Allow Victor a fair appeal to present his case.<br>
                    3. Reverse the disqualification, honoring the voters’ choice.<br>
                    Victor’s 640+ supporters deserve a voice. Let’s protect BUCC’s legacy of justice. Sign now to demand transparency and fairness!<br>
                    Sincerely,<br>
                    BUCC Member & Babcock University Student<br>
                    On Behalf of:<br>
                    Victor Ibironke and Supporters</p>
